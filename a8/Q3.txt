Observation:
  The runtime of tRead is grows a little bit faster than aRead, but compare with sRead, itâ€™s also very significant advantage.

Explanation: 
  It takes more time since the process of thread takes some time. tRead uses thread blocking and unblocking to avoid waiting for the disk latency. When a thread sent out the reading request, it blocks itself to free the processor for other threads to process. Then, the disk has finished DMA process for the request, the thread will be unblocked and continues.
